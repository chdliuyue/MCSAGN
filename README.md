# MCSAGN
Utilizing video data collected by the UAV, the Datafromsky software is employed to extract spatio-temporal location information and tracking markers for the target vehicle, thereby obtaining vehicle trajectory data. To enhance vehicle trajectory prediction, we integrate the concepts of multi-column neu-
ral network and self-attention mechanism into LSTM and GRU networks, named Multi-Column Self-Attention Gated Networks (MCSAGN). In complex intersection scenarios, our models enable precise predictions for straight, right, left, and mixed trajectories.
